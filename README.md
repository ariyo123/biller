This script is for splitting a CSV file called enrollmentReports.csv into individual files for each agent specified in the agents.txt file. It first creates a directory for each agent, then reads the enrollmentReports.csv file and writes the relevant lines for each agent to a new file in their respective directory. Finally, it reads each of these new files, determines what to pay each agent based on the contents of the file, and writes this information to another file.

Here is a summary of what the script does:

Reads the enrollmentReports.csv file and splits it into individual files for each agent, writing the relevant lines to the new files in the respective directories
